Joomlatools Console
=====================

[Joomlatools Console](https://www.joomlatools.com/developer/tools/console/) simplifies the management of Joomla sites. It is designed to work on Linux and MacOS. Windows users can use it in [Joomlatools Vagrant box](https://www.joomlatools.com/developer/tools/vagrant/).

Installation
------------

1. Install using Composer:

 `$ composer global require joomlatools/console`

1. Tell your system where to find the executable by adding the composer directory to your PATH. Add the following line to your shell configuration file called either .profile, .bash_profile, .bash_aliases, or .bashrc. This file is located in your home folder.

 `$ export PATH="$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin"`

1. Verify the installation

 `$ joomla --version`

1. To create a new site with the latest Joomla version, run:

  ```shell
     joomla site:create testsite
  ```

   The newly installed site will be available at /var/www/testsite and testsite.test after that. The default Super User's name and password is set to: `admin` / `admin`.

   By default, the web server root is set to _/var/www_. You can pass _--www=/my/server/path_ to commands for custom values. You can choose the Joomla version or the sample data to be installed:

   ```shell
     joomla site:create testsite --joomla=2.5 --sample-data=blog
   ```

1. For other available options, run:

  `$ joomla --list`
